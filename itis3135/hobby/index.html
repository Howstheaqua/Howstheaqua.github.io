                    <dt>Form Factors</dt>
                    <dd>The defining part of any keyboard is the form factor. This is the shape of the keyboard. There are many different form factors that are available.</dd>
                    <dt>Key Switches</dt>
                    <dd>The most important part that makes these keyboards what they are are the key switches. 
                        These are the parts that go under the keys and activate to signal that you have pressed that key. These are mechanical switches and thats what gives the keyboard its name.</dd>
                    <dt>PCB</dt>
                    <dd>The next most important part is the PCB(<em>Printed Circuit Board</em>), which is where the switches are attached to. The PCB functions at the brain of the keyboard.</dd>
                    <dt>Plate</dt>
                    <dd>The next part is the plate that sits between the switches and PCB and holds everything in the right place. This is also where the stabilizers live to support the larger keys like space and enter.</dd>
                    <dt>Case</dt>
                    <dd>The case is the final part that wraps everything up in one nice big package.</dd>
                    <dt>Keycaps</dt>
                    <dd>The keycaps are the final part that completes the keyboard. These are the parts that you actually press to activate the switches.</dd>

                    <dt>TKL</dt>
                    <dd>TKL stands for Ten Key Less. It is a 80% keyboard that does not have a number pad. This is a quite popular keyboard form factor because it is smaller than full size boards. It retains a lot of functionality like the function keys and arrow keys, while only sacrificing
                        the number pad which a lot of people don't mind losing.</dd>
                    <dt>Full Size</dt>
                    <dd>Full size keyboards are the most common type of keyboard. They are just standard keyboard and most desktop computers have them.</dd>
                    <dt>60%</dt>
                    <dd>60% keyboards are the smallest widely available form factor. They are the most compact and portable. They lose out on functionality like arrow keys and function keys.</dd>
                    <dt>75%</dt>
                    <dd>75% keyboards are the second smallest form factor. They are slightly larger than 60% keyboards but are still very compact and portable. They are basically a compact TKL keyboard with a few missing keys.</dd>
                    <dt>Other</dt>
                    <dd>There are many other niche form factors that are available. Some of these include 40% and 65%. These are pretty rare to find and are typically more expensive</dd>

                    <dt>Linear</dt>
                    <dd>Linear switches are the most common type of switch. They have a smooth linear feel to them and are the easiest to get used to. The switch moves straight down and activates at a certain point</dd>
                    <dt>Tactile</dt>
                    <dd>Tactile switches are the next most common type of switch. They have a bump in the middle of the switch that you can feel when you press the key. This bump is what gives the tactile feel to the switch. This bump is also when the switch activate</dd>
                    <dt>Clicky</dt>
                    <dd>Clicky switches are the least common type of switch. They have a bump in the middle of the switch that you can feel when you press the key, however this bump also makes an audible click when it is activated.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>I personally like linear switches the most. I believe that these switches give the best feel while typing and make typing enjoyable. My keyboard has a switch called milky yellows made by a company called Gateron</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The main difference between plates are the material they are made up. While different materials are more expensive than other the reason for the difference is typing feel. Different
                    materials have different feels to them and some people prefer one over the other.</p>
                <dl>
